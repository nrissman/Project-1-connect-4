    //grab the s divs or the div "board"  and turn them into an array or loop over them some how
// -game loads 
//// -rules and objectives display on screen out of the way of gameplay (maybe you click a button that links to them)
// -player clicks coin flip to receive color (red always goes first)
// -can only select slots that are directly above taken slots (i.e you can’t have floating pieces)
// -player one selects slot 
// -token appears and slot becomes “taken” (can’t play on taken slots)
// -Player turn indicator changes 
// -player two selects slot
// -token appears and slot becomes taken
// -if four of the same players pieces are detected in a row that player wins 
// -the four winning pieces are highlighted  and a win message is displayed
// -if all 42 pieces are played with no winner the game ends in a tie and a tie message is displayed

//make 42 slots in that container and grab them//
//make them clickable 
//write functions to apply to each slot
//apply color to the clicked slots 
//make them unclickable once clicked 
//player one 
//player two


grab the s divs or the div "board"  and turn them into an array or loop over them some how
